We decided to use this a data dictionary for our DSL for the project because of its versatility and usability. 
Applying new attributes to each state is easily accomplished for more complex paths. 
Additionally, formatting the JSON file in this manner makes it easier to parse in the directions correctly and make sure that each attribute is correctly defined.
