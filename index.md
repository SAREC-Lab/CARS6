To right! Take it back now ya'll... 
Time to make a turtlebot dance!!

### Project Vision Statement

The goal of our project is to use voice recognition to make our turtlebot do the Cha Cha Slide. We will create a library of phrases from the song for our turtlebot to react and dance along to, following the steps choreographed by DJ Casper. To do this we will use the Pocketsphinx python library which allows for the voice recognition software.

# Use Case 
**Name**: Turtle cha cha

**ID**: UC1

**Description**: Turtle bot completes user specified cha cha dance move

**Primary Actor(s)**: User

**Stakeholders & Interests: User - entertained by turtlebot **

- Pre-Conditions: Turtlebot system is active; Turtlebot has assigned routine for cha cha command; Turtlebot can hear and process commands

- Post-Conditions: Success: Turtlebot Successfully completes designated cha cha move on command; Failure: Turtlebot completes the wrong move

Trigger: Turtlebot receives a command to do the cha cha

**Main Success Scenario**:

1. The Turtle bot is active and ready to receive command.
2. User says voice command to cha cha
3. Turtlebot performs cha cha
4. Turtlebot completes cha cha and awaits next command

**Alternative Steps**:
1. Turtlebot receives another voice command and adds it to queue

**Exceptions**:
1. In step 2, instead of voice command, user manually types command
